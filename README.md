# AI-Powered-Driver-Drowsiness-Detection-System
AI-Powered Driver Drowsiness Detection System using python

ðŸ”¹ Project Overview

I developed an AI-driven drowsiness detection system using OpenCV, TensorFlow, and deep learning to enhance road safety. This system continuously monitors a driverâ€™s eye state in real-time using a webcam and triggers an alarm when signs of drowsiness are detected.

ðŸ”¥ Key Features

âœ… Real-time face & eye detection with OpenCV
âœ… Deep learning model trained to classify "Drowsy" or "Awake"
âœ… Webcam-based monitoring for continuous tracking
âœ… Automatic alarm system using Pygame for instant audio alerts
âœ… Standalone Python application (No web frameworks required)

ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
Deep Learning: TensorFlow/Keras
Computer Vision: OpenCV, NumPy
Real-time Video Processing: OpenCV
Alert System: Pygame (for sound notifications)
ðŸ’¡ Impact
This system helps prevent road accidents by detecting driver fatigue in real-time and providing immediate alerts. It can be integrated into vehicle safety systems to improve driver awareness and road safety.
